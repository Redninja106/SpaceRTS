 - formations
 - combat
   - missiles/chainguns should share targets
 - better camera
   - zoom level fade in/out
   - screen space distance awareness (ie for dragging)
 - ui rework
   - proper element adding / dynamic guis
   - popup modals
   - hover menus
   - scrolling
 - right click to deselect, left click move
 - proper high speed interplanetary travel

 FOR GAMEPLAY:
 - asteroid mining
 - headquarters / build limits
   - can build one headquarters per planet
   - headquarters prevents other players from building on that planet
   - can upgrade to a command center or smth to allow another one to be built on same planet
   - game is lost when all headquartes/command centers are destroyed
   - can build on any planet
 - manufactories / part requirements
 - enemy AI !!!!!!!
 - win conditions
 - 

 later on for gameplay:
 - different ship sizes
 - stations
 - fog of war system + radars
 

 COOL IDEAS:
 - laser rays: emitters/reflectors, chain together to increase damage exponentially
 - world eater: giant ship that eats small moons (and everything on them) for materials
 - orbital ring: giant ring around planet that has a building grid and free power
