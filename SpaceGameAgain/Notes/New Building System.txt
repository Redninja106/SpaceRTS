NEW BUILDING SYSTEM

- buildings become more abstract (sort of zoning)

- zones:
  - zones are 1x1 an can be placed in chunks
  - chunks with certain shapes can be ungraded into buildings
  - chunks have a size limit for progression (lock powerful buildings behind large platforms)
  - synergies to encourage thought about planet layout (ie economic/idustrial adjacency bonuses)

- types of zones:
  - industrial (upgrades to shipyards + more)
  - scientific (expands zone size limit, superweapon access, buildings that grant bonuses, etc)
  - economic (produces money & power, can specialize with buildings)
  - defensive (turrets etc)
